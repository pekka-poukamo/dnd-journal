# Coverage Implementation - Simple & Actionable

## What Was Done

Added simple test coverage with actionable PR feedback that complies with project ADRs.

## Changes Made

### Files Added
- `.c8rc.json` - Simple coverage config (80% target, warns but doesn't fail)
- `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - PR comments for changed files only
- `docs/COVERAGE.md` - Simple documentation

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added c8 dependency and `npm run coverage` script
- `README.md` - Added coverage command and badge

## Key Features

✅ **PR Comments**: Shows coverage for changed files only
✅ **Non-blocking**: Warns but doesn't fail PRs
✅ **Actionable**: File-by-file breakdown with visual indicators
✅ **Relevant scope**: Only covers files touched in the PR

## PR Comment Example

```
## 📊 Coverage Report

| File | Lines Covered | Percentage |
|------|---------------|------------|
| `js/app.js` | 45/62 | ⚠️ 73% |
| `js/utils.js` | 89/91 | ✅ 98% |

**Coverage target: 80%**
*Coverage check warns but does not block PRs*
```

## Compliance Check

✅ **ADR-0002 (Functional Programming)**: Simple functional approach
✅ **ADR-0005 (Mandatory Testing)**: Encourages test coverage
✅ **ADR-0006 (No Build Tools)**: c8 is a test tool, not a build tool
✅ **ADR-0007 (Feature Freeze)**: Essential testing enhancement
✅ **Style Guide**: Simple, actionable, no complexity

## Usage

```bash
npm run coverage  # Shows coverage, warns if <80%, never fails
```

## Result

- **Before**: No coverage visibility
- **After**: Actionable coverage feedback on changed files
- **CI**: Non-blocking coverage reports on PRs
- **Developer experience**: See exactly which files need attention

The implementation balances simplicity with actionable feedback for developers.
