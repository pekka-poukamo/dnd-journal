# Coverage Implementation - Radically Simple

## What Was Done

Added minimal test coverage checking that complies with project ADRs.

## Changes Made

### Files Added
- `.c8rc.json` - Simple coverage config (80% line threshold)
- `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - Basic coverage check on PRs
- `docs/COVERAGE.md` - Minimal documentation

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added c8 dependency and `npm run coverage` script
- `README.md` - Added coverage command and badge

## Compliance Check

✅ **ADR-0002 (Functional Programming)**: No classes or complex objects
✅ **ADR-0005 (Mandatory Testing)**: Enforces test coverage requirement
✅ **ADR-0006 (No Build Tools)**: c8 is a test tool, not a build tool
✅ **ADR-0007 (Feature Freeze)**: Minimal testing enhancement, not a new feature
✅ **Style Guide**: Simple configuration, no complex scripts

## Removed Complexity

❌ Complex coverage analyzer script
❌ PR comment automation 
❌ Multi-reporter configuration
❌ Detailed threshold configuration
❌ Changed-files tracking
❌ Coverage comparison logic

## Usage

```bash
npm run coverage  # Shows coverage, fails if <80%
```

## Result

- **Before**: No coverage visibility
- **After**: Simple 80% line coverage requirement
- **CI**: Coverage checked on all PRs
- **Compliance**: Fully aligned with project philosophy

The implementation is now radically simple while providing the essential coverage checking functionality.
